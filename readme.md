Software Carpentry Workshop Notes for Bash, Python, and Git 

Luke Colosi: lcolosi@ucsd.edu 

This repository contains my notes from the software carpentry workshop (SWC). It is a combination of my own written notes and segments from SWC tutorials.
The Bash and Git notes are in one latex .tex file. The Python tutorial is in a .py file. 

Acknowledgements: I would like to thanks SWC for supply all the material for the bash, python, and git lessons.
